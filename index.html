                    <p>Coal measurement provides reliable volume estimation, optimizing power plant scheduling. We developed a multi-view measurement system with over 130 cameras using Structure from Motion (SfM). Advanced algorithms in camera calibration, feature extraction, matching, and dense reconstruction enable accurate results with less than 10% error on a 10% budget.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>System of Active Hazard Detection in Nanding Thermal Power Plant</strong> (2020.10)
                    <p>The active hazard detection system in power plant seamlessly integrates visual signals from CCTV monitors with advanced visual intelligent methods, enabling a highly effective sub-second response. This system has been successfully operational for 4 years.</p>
