Hi, this is Hao(Oliver) Wu. I'm a third-year graduate student in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.en.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC), under the supervision of [Dr.Lianli Gao](https://lianligao.github.io/) . I have received my B.Eng(Computer Science) from Shandong University in 2021 and advised by [Dr.Yanwei Zheng](https://ivyzheng.github.io/).

My research interests includes computer vision and artifical inteligence, especially in [few-shot learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#few-shot). I think it's a crucial aspect of understanding representation learning, and recently popular in-context learning is exactly new form of few-shot learning in era of Large Models. Also, I have some experience and passion in medical image analysis and join in an ophthalmic medicine program cooperated with Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital.

Now I'm actively seeking admission to a full-time Ph.D program at Fall 2024, and please contact me via <a href="mailto:wh.pyjnqd@gmail.com">wh.pyjnqd@gmail.com</a> if you are interested in me.
