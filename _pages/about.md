[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/haowu_cv.pdf)

I'm a third-year graduate student in [CSE Department](https://www.en.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)**, under the supervision of [Dr.Lianli Gao](https://lianligao.github.io/) . I have received my B.Eng(Computer Science) from **Shandong University** in 2021 and advised by [Dr.Yanwei Zheng](https://ivyzheng.github.io/).

My research interests include computer vision and artificial intelligence, especially in [**Few-shot Learning(FSL)**](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#few-shot). It's a crucial aspect of understanding representation learning, and recently popular in-context learning is exactly the form of few-shot learning in era of Large Models. Also, I have some experience and passion in **Medical Image Analysis** and join in an ophthalmic medicine program cooperated with Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital.

Now I'm actively seeking admission to a full-time Ph.D program at Fall 2024, and please contact me via <a href="mailto:wh.pyjnqd@gmail.com">wh.pyjnqd@gmail.com</a> if you are interested in me.



[Others] What's the meaning of **pyjnqd** in my gmail address?
My hometown is a small industrial city called [**P**u**Y**ang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyang), and I have studied in [**J**i**N**an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan) and [**Q**ing**D**ao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao). Bachelor's experience in these two cities changes me a lot and the name **pyjnqd** lets me remember where I come from and have stayed, with rich self-development. Thanks for the love and support from my family.
