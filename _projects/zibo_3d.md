<p>Coal Measurement offers a reliable coal volume estimation, enabling effective scheduling of power
plant operations. We has successfully developed a multi-view based measurement system, incorporating over 100 cameras to achieve cost-effective 3D modeling. Through the implementation of advanced algorithms in camera calibration,
feature mining and matching, and dense reconstruction, we have achieved less than 10% error with 10% budget.</p>
